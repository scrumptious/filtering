<h3>Testing</h3>

There are no tests included yet. I believe it would be beneficial to cover all of the different cases based on amount of "words" found in each record/row.

Right now splitting into different homeowners will work for sample data, however there will be definitely edge cases where it will not recognise input data correctly especially in longer rows.
